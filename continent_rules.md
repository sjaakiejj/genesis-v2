Yes — and this is the **right question** to ask if you want a plate map that _doesn’t quietly break geology_ .
Below is a **concrete, usable rule set** you can literally follow step-by-step when drawing continents onto plates.

I’ll keep this **procedural** , not academic.

---

## RULE SET: Drawing continents onto tectonic plates

### **Rule 1 — Continents require continental crust**

**Non-negotiable**

- A _continent_ = a large, coherent block of **continental crust**
- Oceanic crust **cannot** host continents

👉 If a plate is **purely oceanic** , it may have:

- Volcanic islands
- Island arcs
  But **no continent**

---

### **Rule 2 — Plates may carry both crust types**

This is **normal** , not special.

- Most real plates are **mixed**
- A continent usually sits on:
  - Continental core
  - Surrounded by oceanic crust on the same plate

👉 When drawing:

- First draw **plates**
- Then assign **crust type regions inside plates**

Do **not** assume:

> “continental plate = land only”

---

### **Rule 3 — A continent must mostly sit on ONE plate**

**Strong rule, with rare exceptions**

- One plate should contain:
  - ≥70–80% of the continent’s area
- Otherwise the continent becomes:
  - Geologically unstable
  - Fragmented
  - Extremely mountainous

⚠️ You _may_ split a continent across plates **only if** :

- There is an active collision zone
- There is a major rift forming

Examples:

- India–Eurasia (collision)
- East African Rift (future split)

### **Rule 4 — Continental crust does NOT subduct easily**

This governs your boundaries.

When continental crust meets:

#### Oceanic crust → **oceanic subducts**

- Creates:
  - Coastal mountains
  - Volcano chains
  - Deep trenches offshore

#### Continental crust → **continental crust**

- Neither subducts
- Result:
  - Massive mountain belts
  - High plateaus

👉 If your map has:

- A continent diving cleanly under another → ❌ wrong
- A big mountain chain between continents → ✅ correct

---

### **Rule 5 — Oceanic plates can have land, but not continents**

Allowed on oceanic plates:

- Hotspot islands
- Island arcs
- Ridge islands

Forbidden:

- Large stable landmasses with old cores

👉 If land on an oceanic plate:

- It must be **volcanic**
- Geologically young
- Often linear or arc-shaped

---

### **Rule 6 — Continents have a “shape logic”**

Continents are **not blobs** .

They tend to have:

- Broad interiors (cratons)
- Irregular coastlines
- Passive margins on one or more sides
- Active margins on others

Quick check:

- One smooth coast + one jagged mountain coast = 👍
- Entirely spiky coastline everywhere = 👎 (too tectonically busy)

---

### **Rule 7 — Old continents are boring in the middle**

This is realism gold.

- Continental interiors:
  - Flat
  - Stable
  - Low seismic activity
- Drama happens at **edges**

If your continent:

- Is mountainous everywhere → unrealistic
- Has calm plains + violent edges → realistic

---

### **Rule 8 — Microcontinents are allowed (sparingly)**

You may include:

- Submerged continental blocks
- Broken fragments near continents

Rules:

- Rare
- Often partially submerged
- Often tectonically stretched

Use them as:

- World-building flavor
- Geological mystery

---

### **Rule 9 — Don’t align everything**

Nature hates symmetry.

Avoid:

- Continents centered perfectly on plates
- Coastlines tracing plate boundaries exactly
- Plates shaped like continents

Let:

- Plate boundaries cut through oceans
- Continents sit _off-center_

---

## Minimal checklist (use this while drawing)

Ask yourself:

- ⬜ Does every continent sit on continental crust?
- ⬜ Is at least 70% of each continent on one plate?
- ⬜ Are mountain belts explained by collisions?
- ⬜ Are oceanic plates limited to volcanic land?
- ⬜ Are interiors calmer than edges?

If yes → your map is geologically solid.

## If you want next steps

I can:

- Walk you through **placing one continent step-by-step**
- Review a plate sketch and point out issues
- Generate a **procedural checklist** you can reuse for every world
- Help you tune this specifically for **Aeris / Thaleia-style planets**

Just tell me how detailed you want to go 🌍
